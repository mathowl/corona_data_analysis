Data analysis for spread nCov-2019 

The data used can be found on https://github.com/CryptoKass/ncov-data/blob/master/world.daily-confirmed.jhu.csv
Regression analysis is performed on the newly confirmed cases with respect to time in days.
Currently, the Jupyter notebook only concerns cases in China since data for other countries is insufficient.
